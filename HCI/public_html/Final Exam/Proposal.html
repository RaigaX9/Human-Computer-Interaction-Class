<hr width = "50%" />
<center><h2><b>Goals and Objective For The Website:</b></h2></center>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For this project, I will create a museum website called the Atlanta South Eastern Museum (ASEM). 
This is where anyone will learn about the history of Georgia and North Florida from 1500 to 1821. It will cover from the discovery of Georgia and Florida to the time where Spain
surrendered Florida to the United States.</p> <p>For the website, it will consist of several pages such as the home page, about us, gallery, information, and
the contacts page. Each of these pages will provide their own information for what these sections will include. For example, the "About Us" page will give a brief description
of what the website and the museum is about. Another example is the "Gallery" page, which will consist of pictures of drawings, documents, and models that are in the museum. Another is the "Information"
page where it will provide some details about the history of Georgia and Florida. The website's main purpose is to provide some historic information of Georgia and Florida from
1500 to 1821 for those that are interested in learning about them.  </font></p>

<center><h2><b>What are the users trying to learn and/or accomplish at the web site?</b></h2></center>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The users will learn about the history of Georgia and Florida from 1500 to 1821. This website is an opportunity to not only 
gain knowledge as to what happened during that time, but they can learn how it's affecting the present time as well as how it will affect in the future. 
It’s going to give them vast knowledge in terms of how they discovered both of these states and why certain battles occured during that time. This is especially good for those
that doesn't know the history during that period and they can always come visit the website to get basic information about them. Also, if users wants to do some kind of historic research,
then they can use this website as their main source for it. That way, the ASEM will not only provide information at their museum physically, but on online as well and that way, this 
can become the most notable museum that is out there in Atlanta.</font></p>
