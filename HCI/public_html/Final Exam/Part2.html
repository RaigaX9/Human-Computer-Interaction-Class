<center><h2><b>The ASEM wants its museum visitors to have an enhanced experience using technology. Explain how you would accomplish this using new advances in AR and/or VR?</b></h2></center>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> 
The new technology that is going to enhance user's experience with it is using Augmented Reality (AR). To do this, there are a couple of ways the visitors can do this. One of them is that
they can download the ASEM app, which is available for the iPhone, iPad, iTouch, and the Android, which includes a feature of using AR when they come to the museum and all of them
requires a camera in them. This goes for the same with the Nintendo 3DS which will also have the same feature as well. If the visitors do not have any one of them, the museum will provide the visitors a small touchscreen device 
that uses AR to contribute experience of using technology. Both the app and the AR device will provide simple instructions of what they need to do to use the AR in the museum. 
There, if they point at a photograph or a drawing, a 3D image will appear in front of them that includes a small description as to what it is. Also, the visitors can use the 
touch screen to move the object to see what's around it or scroll down to see more details in the description. Some of them will not only show a 3D model, but it will show an 
animation in there as well depending on which one of them have that. Another is that if they pointed at one of the documents, it will show both a picture of who wrote it and 
the entire document written in there as well. The reason why using the AR on documents is because it's for those at a certain age or have different eye vision will be able to read them at a close range of their hands. Last, if they use their devices to 
point at a model, a 3D version of that model will be in the device for the visitors to view all around it. Along with that there will be some animations as well to show a reenactment 
of what happened during a certain time period with some information.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> Not only you can use AR at the museum, but you can also use it at the website as well. However, it will not show everything that is from the
museum that does AR. On the other hand, it will still show the same things you've seen at the museum such as 3D images and animations along with descriptions of what they are. Overall
using AR for the museum will have the users further their gain of knowledge of using new technology during this day. It will become much more easier and efficient for them to use to 
not only learn about the history of South Eastern United States, but understand how technology around us is growing everyday.
