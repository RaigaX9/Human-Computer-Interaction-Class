<center><h2><b>Name of the website: Botinnovations.com</center>
<hr width = "50%" />
<center><h2><b>Goals and Objective For The Website:</b></h2></center>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For this project, I will create a non-profit organization website that is about robotics being used around the world. This is where anyone can share their ideas and explore the world of robotics in order to understand how they all work. It will consist of several sections such as videos, pictures, and news articles from different sources that relates to robots. For example, I’ll post a news article, a picture, or a video that shows how industrial robots are being used in at automotive companies. Another example will be humanoid robots, like ASIMO or from different universities and countries creating them, which will show the users more information as to how they can move and follow certain commands. I can post something that is not only educational, but something fun and entertainment such as some funny pictures and videos about them or something from a robot competition. Each of these sections will only include something that’s robot related whether it’s for educational purposes or for something that users can enjoy. Also, there will also be a section where users can submit their own work or ideas of their own robots that they’ve made. This website is intended for those that are interested in robots and technology and wants to pursue a career or a hobby of making them.</font></p>

<center><h2><b>What are the users trying to learn and/or accomplish at the web site?</b></h2></center>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The users will learn about the current events of robots being developed around the world. This website is an opportunity to not only gain knowledge as to what they are, but they can learn how to build their own based on what they have seen from the website. It’s going to give them an inspiration in terms of what kind of robots they want to create on their own. In order to accomplish this, they can submit their ideas and robots that they’ve in one of the sections for the website and that way, others can understand the techniques they used for making them. For those that are not interested into building one, they can still use this website as their main source to either just submit any kind of idea that would contribute anyone or learn what kind of robots are out there that is being beneficial towards society every day.</font></p>

<div>
<center><h2><b>What tasks do they have and what actions will they take to accomplish these?</b></h2></center>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">They can go into any sections such as the “About”, “Videos”, “Pictures”, “News Articles”, “Submission” and “Contact” where they can search the types of robots that are out there. Here is how this is set up:</p>
<ul>
<p>
<p><li><b>	About Section:</b> Users will click on this section to understand what the website is about.</li></p>
<p><li><b>	Videos Section:</b> Users will watch any kind of videos posted on the website that relates with robotics. This can consist of tutorials, entertainment, and any kind of news relating to the topic. These videos can come from YouTube or any other video websites that have anything to do with robotics.</li></p>
<p><li><b>	Pictures Section:</b> Users will see various pictures of robots posted along with a small description about what they are. The source information will be included in there.</li></p>
<p><li><b>	News Articles Section:</b> Users will read articles from other websites that discusses about robotics and how they are being used. This will consist of summaries about the article and a link that will directly lead them to the full article in another website.</li></p>
<p><li><b>	Submission Section:</b> Users can submit their ideas or the robots that they’ve built by going into this section.</li></p>
<p><li><b>	Contact Section:</b> Users can either call or email to customer service is they have any questions or concerns about the website.</li></p>
</p>
</ul>
<p>
The users can take action for accomplishing their own desires to understand robotics going each of these sections to easily navigate them to different pages. There, they will be in a user-friendly environment where they can enjoy the study of robots in which they can either learn about them or submit their own ideas for it to create them.
